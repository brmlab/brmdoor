* Support for brmwiki update notifications.
	Watch the RSS feed.

* Potentially some prettier icons and richer javascript stubs.


* Have the brmlab sketch do bi-directional TCP communication.
	Currently, it only sends stuff and cannot receive any
	instructions. This is pre-req for features below.
	Alternatively, we may decide we need to switch back to
	USB communication (with reliable USB host) if the ethernet
	shield proves to be too unreliable.

* Way to override status from web page.
	To keep status LED and web page in sync, bi-directional
	communication will be required.

* Way to unlock door remotely (through some secure channel).
	Bi-directional communication will be required.


* Webcam support.
	We will need to figure out where to connect it.

* Picture snapshot support.
	Add a button to the panel that will make the webcam
	take a snapshot - useful for letting the world know
	who came in, or to publish random stuff. Post to twitpic
	or some-such.

* Live-feed support.
	Turn webcam on/off based on the second switch. Route the
	stream to some public place.
