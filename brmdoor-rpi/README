This version of brmdoor requires:
	irssi configured according to ./irssi/config with loaded scripts from ./irssi/scripts
	libnfc-compatible smartcard reader
	installed libnfc
	nfc-getcard.c compiled against libnfc (with -lnfc) and saved as "./nfc-getcard"
	to be running on RaspberryPi (or simillar with GPIO pins exported through /proc)
	variables in brmdoor-rpi.sh modified according to reality
	list of allowed cards in allowed.list in the correct format
