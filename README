Note for PN532 version: if you want brmdoor to add card UID after "CARD"
message (not just nick), set printFullUID to true in brmdoor/brmdoor.ino.


==== Adding new UIDs to the database ====

There are two lists - the new proper and the old deperecated with truncated UIDs.
When adding, the new list is better place.

The new proper list is searched for UIDs first.

===== Using the new proper list - recommended =====

Edit the cardids_proper.h file and add your UID and nick to a new line, which
will become part of the ACLproper array. E.g. to add UID 04c24ce9ad2780 that is
7 bytes long and adding nick "voyeur1", add line:

  { 7, {0x04, 0xc2  0x4c, 0xe9, 0xad, 0x27, 0x80}, "voyeur1" },


===== Using the old broken truncated list - not recommended =====

Edit the cardids.h file. If the new card UID is 4 bytes long, e.g. 35b018d4,
compute BCC, which is xor of these four bytes (0x49 in this case). Then add

  { {0x00, 0x00, 0x35, 0xb0, 0x18, 0xd4, 0x49}, "mifare_classic_1" },

The first two bytes are magic bytes that originate in the old reader, just use
two zero bytes as above. The last byte is BCC we computed before. But you can
use zero, the software doesn't need it.

If the card UID is longer than 4 bytes (7 or 10 bytes), e.g. 04c24ce9ad2780,
discard last four bytes of the UID and prepend 0x88. Use this "newly" created
UID as if the card had only 4 byte UID, just like above.

  { {0x00, 0x00, 0x88, 0x04, 0xc2, 0x4c, 0x02}, "truncated_voyeur1" },

The old reader didn't support ISO14443 SELECT cascade 2 and 3. Hence the broken
UIDs.
